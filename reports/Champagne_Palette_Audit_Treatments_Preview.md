## Hero Background Before/After
- Before: Hero glass panels carried a bright teal/mint cast from the lighter gradient stops.
- After: Heroes now use a dusk Champagne gradient (magenta → teal → soft gold via tokens) with the single soft-light `/brand/waves-bg-1920.webp` texture retained and a lightly inked glass base for contrast.

## Card Background Before/After
- Before: Section cards and CTAs leaned into pastel/mint overlays that washed out the dusk palette.
- After: Cards share a dusk gradient (ink-tinted magenta → teal → soft gold) drawn only from the Champagne tokens, keeping colour depth without mint bias across all preview routes.

## Token Usage
- Primary hues now draw directly from the canonical set via tokens: #C2185B (magenta), #40C4B4 (teal), #D4AF37 (gold), #F9E8C3 (soft gold), #0B0D0F (ink), and #FFFFFF for text/highlights.
- No additional brand colours were introduced; gradients and keylines are composed solely from the Champagne token set and ink mixes.

## After v2 Adjustments
- Hero surfaces now use the canonical magenta→teal→gold gradient with the single soft-light `/brand/waves-bg-1920.webp` texture at low opacity, ensuring the wave is visible without muting colour.
- Preview cards share a refreshed ink-to-Champagne gradient with ink mixing capped at 40% and a soft-gold keyline, restoring the dusk glow without brown casts.
