The following files were created while scaffolding the Champagne treatments stage:

- app/preview/treatments/composite-bonding/_sections/CompositeBondingFaqSection.tsx
- app/preview/treatments/composite-bonding/_sections/CompositeBondingHeroSection.tsx
- app/preview/treatments/composite-bonding/_sections/CompositeBondingHighlightsSection.tsx
- app/preview/treatments/composite-bonding/_sections/CompositeBondingPlanSessionSection.tsx
- app/preview/treatments/composite-bonding/_sections/CompositeBondingResultsSection.tsx
- components/preview/cta/TreatmentConsultationCta.tsx

- components/preview/nav/TreatmentBreadcrumb.tsx
- components/preview/theme/ChampagneTreatmentSurface.tsx
- config/champagne/Manus_Section_Catalog.json
- reports/Scaffold_Report.md

> **Preview guard note:** These scaffolds were relocated from production directories into the `/app/preview/**` and `components/preview/**` namespaces to satisfy the preview-only guard. Once the content is approved, promote the modules via a `release/composite-bonding-stage-1` branch and re-point the stage metadata.
