# Preview Technology v1 Report

## Sections added
- Champagne Preview Hero with Shoreham-by-Sea technology copy and dual CTAs.
- Digital workflow rail with Scan / Design / Make cards.
- Equipment gallery gradient tiles for iTero, Primescan, CBCT, and 3D printing studio.
- AI & 3D split section with chip list and reusable 3D viewer placeholder shell.
- Sustainability/statistics band with efficiency-focused chips.
- Gradient closing CTA inviting booking or a clinic tour.

## Token usage
- Reused Champagne preview tokens for gradients, cards, and chip borders (`--cpv-card-gradient`, `--cpv-gold-keyline`, `--cpv-chip-bg`, `--smh-` palette variables).
- Typography follows preview classes (`text-display-sm`, `text-eyebrow`, `text-body`).
- Section shells draw from existing CPV card/glass treatments with color-mix on brand magenta, teal, and gold accents.

## Known limitations
- 3D viewer remains a static placeholder shell until WebGL assets are added.
- Iconography uses simple emoji/initial badges pending final pictograms.
- Equipment gallery is text-only; imagery to follow once approved assets are available.
