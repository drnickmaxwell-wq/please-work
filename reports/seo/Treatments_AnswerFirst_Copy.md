**AI Overview (≈55 words)**  
Veneers are thin coverings bonded to the front of teeth to fix chips, gaps and shade. We use digital planning to minimise preparation, match colour accurately and protect enamel. The page lists process, aftercare and typical longevity, with photos and monthly finance. Begin with an e‑consult for personalised advice.

## /treatments/implants
**Featured Snippet (≈50 words)**
