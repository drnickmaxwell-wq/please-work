# Champagne Render Pass v1

## Summary
- Established a dusk-ink Champagne canvas with clarified glass, card, and CTA tokens to align preview surfaces with Manus atlas guidance.
- Skinned hero, cards, CTA, FAQ, testimonials, and 3D viewer with layered gradients, gold keylines, and glass depth drawn from existing assets.
- Wrapped preview and treatment routes in the Champagne layout so the preview playground inherits the new canvas, typography, and navigation surfaces.

## Visual Notes
- Heroes now use gradient, wave mask, particles, and grain layers from the Manus asset register while content sits on a glass plate for contrast.
- Cards across treatments, AI tools, testimonials, and team use unified radii, shadows, and chip accents for consistency on the ink canvas.
- CTA and FAQ bands introduce stronger gold focus cues; testimonial carousel gains glass framing and readable navigation.
- Preview canvases adopt the dusk palette; treatment hubs and slugs inherit Champagne layout spacing and shell padding.

## Remaining Gaps / TODOs
- Extend the dusk ink palette into any remaining legacy preview sections (e.g., niche rails) that still lean on lighter paper tokens.
- Consider adding subtle particle/grain toggles to preview heroes based on motion preferences for finer polish.
- Future phases can tune typography weights per Manus atlas for portal/finance routes once those surfaces enter scope.
