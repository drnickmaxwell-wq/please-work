# Champagne Preview Fix Audit v3

## Hero Before / After
- **Before:** Preview heroes sat on the canon gradient but carried extra overlays and a warmer parchment glass that muted the wave arc.
- **After:** Heroes now mirror the home hero with only the canonical magenta→teal→gold gradient plus the `/brand/waves-bg-1920.webp` texture at high visibility, and a lighter smoked-white glass card lifted with a cleaner shadow.

## Cards Before / After
- **Before:** Preview cards skewed darker with ink-heavy fills and thin gradient borders doing most of the colour work.
- **After:** Cards, FAQs, and link tiles use light smoked-glass surfaces built from ink+white mixes, keeping the canonical gradient only as a border accent so content remains bright and legible.

## Compliance
- Tokens were untouched; no new hex values were added.
- Canonical gradient usage remains exact, and guard suites (`guard-rogue-hex`, `brand:guard`, `guard:hero`) remain green in local runs.
