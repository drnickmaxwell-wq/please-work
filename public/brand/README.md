# Brand Asset Dropzone

Place the final production assets here via GitHub web upload (or Git LFS if files exceed normal limits):

- `textures/film-grain-2560x1440.webp`
- `textures/glass-soft.webp`
- `particles/particles-soft.webm` (must have alpha)
- `waves/wave-bg.webp`
- `waves/wave-mask.svg`

The manifest at `public/brand/manifest.json` already points to these paths.
No assets are committed in this repo to keep PRs light and avoid binary churn.
